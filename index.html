          <h2>Animal Species Count per State in Australia</h2>
          <p class="large-text">
            Australia is one of the world's most diverse hotspots. About 87% of its mammals, 93% of reptiles and 94% of frogs, plus about 45% of birds, are found nowhere else on Earth. 
            (Animals | NSW State of the Environment, 2021)
          </p>

          <p class="medium-text"> 
            Queensland stands out in our data as the most biodiverse state, with 38,275 distinct animal species recorded as of 2024. Queensland holds around 70% of Australia's mammals and 80% of its native birds, and more than half of its reptiles, frogs and plants, making it widely described as the nation's most naturally diverse state.
            (Biodiscovery in Queensland | Business Queensland, 2020). Following Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia emerge as the next richest states in our data, with about 29,739 and 20,946 distinct animal species recorded respectively. 
            These figures reflect NSW's spread from alpine ranges to temperate forests and coasts, and WA's vast deserts, tropical north and globally significant southwest hotspot.

        <h2>Species Discovery Trends and Group Distribution</h2>
        <p class="section-description">
          The line chart reveals a remarkable upward trend in species discoveries from 2000 to 2024, with Queensland and New South Wales leading in both volume and growth rate. This acceleration reflects advances in biodiversity research methods, increased survey efforts, and improved taxonomic documentation. The donut chart complements this by showing that insects comprise the vast majority of documented species, followed by other invertebrates and birds. Together, these visualizations highlight both the pace of ongoing biodiversity discovery in Australia and the taxonomic groups driving these numbers, with invertebrates representing the frontier of unexplored diversity.

        <h2>Threat Status and Public Awareness</h2>
        <p class="section-description">
          The 100% stacked bars show that <em>Endangered</em> and <em>Critically Endangered</em> categories
          account for a large share of threatened species across several groups. The small but non-zero
          presence of <em>Extinct</em> and <em>Extinct in the wild</em> segments highlights that losses have
          already occurred. The green sliver, <em>Conservation Dependent</em>, reminds us that some species
          survive only with ongoing management. Paired with the popularity ranking on the right, this section
          helps identify high-risk species that may receive less public attention—areas where awareness,
          funding and targeted conservation could have outsized impact.
